# Considerations

## Layout

### The overall structure/scaffolding

### It can also pertain to smaller considerations, like how arrange information on the screen and the visual hierarchy you create with your UI chrome.

^ Red is more brilliant when overlayed on a black background. It's lifeless against orange, and once again pops when over blue-green. It also appears bigger when over black.

## Some Terminology

---
* _Hue_ - Value from color wheel (spectrum of light)
* _Saturation_ - purity or vividness
* _Brightness_ - light to dark
* _Tint_ - Add white to a hue
* _Shade_ - Add black to a hue
* _Tone_ - Add grey to a hue

^ HSB are for digital applications, TST is from the world of painting. Hue represents a pure color (e.g. red). Saturation refers to purity or vividness of color (pure to grey, at a constant brightness). Brightness is dark (black) to fully illuminated.

## Typography

---

### Possibly the most important aspect of digital design, especially for web and app developers, as most websites and many apps are predominantly text.

---

## Typography has one plain duty before it and that is to convey information in writing. No argument or consideration can absolve typography from this duty. A printed work which cannot be read becomes a product without purpose.
--Emil Ruder 1969, Swiss typographer

## Affordances

---

### An affordance is often taken as a relation between an object or an environment and an organism, that affords the opportunity for that organism to perform an action. For example, a knob affords twisting, and perhaps pushing, while a cord affords pulling. As a relation, an affordance exhibits the possibility of some action, and is not a property of either an organism or its environment alone.
