* Quiz
* Homework Review
* Tools on Tuesday: Apple Developer Portal

### Topics

* Review of:
	* TableViews and UITableViewController
	* M in MVC (Model-View-Controller)


## Homework - Jackpot

Create a single view application that shows a table view as its main interface to the user. Provide a Navigation Controller to handle eventual view transitions (we'll add these later). Add an "add" button to the navigation bar that when tapped, will generate a quick pick lottery number and place it in a cell in the table view.

Quick pick is defined as a lottery number that is randomly generated. A lottery number is 6 integers that are within the range 1 through 53. Picking a number does not preclude it from being picked again for another of the 6 in the sequence.

### Objectives

After completing this assignment, you shouldâ€¦

* know how to use a UITableViewController to display a list of related data
* understand how to enable on-demand cell creation by the user and add them to the view
* be able to create a model class to store information and easily transport this info around the app.
