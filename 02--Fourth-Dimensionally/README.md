## The Right Mindset

The second stage of [the Writing Process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_process) is [Drafting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_document): writing a series of quick, rough attempts at cohesive thought with minimal editing. Through this process, the author revises her stance on the organization and presentation of the ideas in the piece, also revising her outline in the process. 

Your next step towards your Right Mindset journal is to produce your first Rough Draft, which you will create a new page in your wiki for, if you already have a page for the outline.
