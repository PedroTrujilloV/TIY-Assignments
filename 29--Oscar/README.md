## Homework - Movie Mania

This weekend you'll build an app that interacts with [OMDB](http://omdbapi.com).

The API is simple to interact with and will give you basic stats on any movie you search for.

The API provides lots of info on the title, including a link to the movie poster. Be sure to incorporate this poster somewhere in the app.

App Examples:

* Movie search app that shows detailed stats on the title. Basically building an IMDb-like app.
* App to help user search for upcoming movies, perhaps with ability to create a list of "must see" movies for the future.
* An app that stores movies that have been searched and allows the user to sort them based on various criteria.

The above is certainly not an exhaustive list, so feel free to use your imagination. The only requirements for this app are as follows:

* You must do a minimum amount of design pre-work. This means that you think about the general flow/navigation and what kind of affordances you'll use to indicate interactivity. This can be rough sketches on paper, digital mockups using Sketch or similar, or even a whiteboard. If the design is analog, take a picture and attach to your issue. If it is digital, add a screenshot.
* You must use Objective-C. A hybrid project is also off limits.
* Your pair/group will demo your app on Monday to the class. There cannot be any partially complete features in the demo, so if you can't finish something, hide the UI/comment out the code so it isn't shown at runtime.
* This assignment does not REQUIRE a paired-programming approach, but I would still highly recommend that you work on the code together.
* In addition, you must create a work log for the assignment and attach names to show which team member completed each task. Paste this into your issue as a comment.

### Pairings for the weekend:
