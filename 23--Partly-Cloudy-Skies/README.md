## Homework - Explore Parse

Create a developer account on Parse.com and explore the admin console as well as the documentation. Choose one of the following previous assignments and try to add a LoginView Controller to allow the user to register/login. Also allow the user to "save" a record in Parse. Perhaps by adding a "favorite" type button to the UI somewhere.

Eligible apps:

* S.H.I.E.L.D. Tracker
* The Grail Diary
* In Due Time
* Dude, Where's My Car? (with this one you would simply replace the NSCoding persistence with saving to Parse)

#### Kata 5

* New kata will be posted after lunch.
